        <p>My name is Brendan MacLean, and I'm a graduate of University of Toronto - Mississauga with an Honours Bachelor
          of Science Degree.  I'm now an aspiring web developer, with working knowledge of Javascript, SQL, and Express, and exposure
          to NodeJS, React, Android Studio and Firebase.</p>

          <h4>Colour Picking Application</h4>
          <p>This is an application I built using HTML, CSS and Javascript to generate colours based on rgb colour codes. The three sliders can be
            used to dynamically change the colour of the background and sample.  The code in the top allows developers to copy
            and paste the code into css and style tags.</p>

          <h3>Colour Picking Game</h3>
          <p>This is a game I built during an online course using HTML, CSS and Javascript, where players attempt to guess the colour
            given by the rgb code at the top of the screen.  The game has different difficulties which add more squares to pick from, and
            the game gives randomized colours to each square on startup, on pressing 'New Colours', and finally on changing difficulty.</p>

        <h3>Fortnite 2-D</h3>
        <p>This game was a university project which our class built in teams of two.  I learned about using NodeJS to install modules, and
        worked with Express, React and jQuery, with a SQLite3 Database to manage profiles.  The game can be played with multiple players when
        run on a server, and had mechanics like health and ammunition refilling, indestructible and destructible obstacles, border walls, and
        even buildings with roofs which disappear once the player is underneath them.  My main role was to build the CRUD operations, using the
        express app to interact with our SQLite3 database, and to expand the React components to build update, register, and delete pages.</p>

        <h3>UpGrade</h3>
        <p>This application is both web and android based, and was a group project for a software development class.  This site
        was built over four sprints of two weeks, in a group of six students.  We also made use of Jira to keep track of our
        respective user stories, and worked to use INVEST principles to maintain our development momentum across the sprints.
        I proposed the idea of a tool which could aid students in keeping track of their assignments and test scores, as our
        school system does not always require professors to upload the grades for the students in their courses if they give
        them a physical copy of it.  I learned basic app development using Android Studio, including using grid layouts to build
        each activity screen.  I also got some exposure to Firebase as I had to build a function for implementation in the app
        that was already present in the website.</p>

        <h3>Expense Tracker App</h3>
        <p>This is a web application built using Express, Sqlite3, jQuery, and Ajax, with the app interacting with and storing data 
          in a Sqlite database file.  This application was a solo project which I developed based on the experience I'd gained from 
          working on the Fortnite 2-D game we built in my Web Development course.  This program proved to be more complex of a project 
          since it relies much more heavily on the CRUD functions to operate as intended, as well as being a project I built entirely 
          on my own.  </p>
